Q1. TensorFlow vs PyTorch
Feature	TensorFlow	PyTorch
Computation graph	Static (define-then-run)	Dynamic (define-by-run)
Syntax style	More structured, less Pythonic	More intuitive, pure Python
Deployment	TensorFlow Serving / Lite / JS	TorchServe / ONNX
Preferred by	Industry, production teams	Researchers, academics
GPU/TPU support	Excellent (Google TPU native)	Excellent (CUDA friendly)

✅ Choose TensorFlow when deploying at scale or on mobile.
✅ Choose PyTorch when doing rapid experimentation or research.

Q2. Use cases for Jupyter Notebooks

Interactive Model Building:
Run code cell-by-cell, visualize training graphs and intermediate outputs.

Data Storytelling & Reporting:
Combine code, markdown, and charts to make explainable AI reports for teams or clients.

Q3. How spaCy Enhances NLP
Task	Basic Python	spaCy
Tokenization	Splits only on spaces	Linguistically accurate
POS Tagging	Not available	Built-in statistical tagger
Named Entity Recognition	Not available	Detects names, orgs, dates
Lemmatization	Manual	Automatic
Speed	Slow on large texts	Optimized in Cython (very fast)

spaCy therefore provides linguistic understanding, not just text splitting.

Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow
Criteria	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Type	Classical ML	Deep Learning
Algorithms	SVM, Decision Tree, KNN	CNN, RNN, Transformers
Ease of use	Beginner-friendly	Intermediate
Deployment	Limited	Strong tools
Community	Mature, academic	Massive, industry-backed# AI-for-Software-Engineering-3
